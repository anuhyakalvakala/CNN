comparing performance of different CNNs on an image classification task.


**CNN Architectures:**

1.	In the first architecture we have taken we have taken image size of 100X100 with the kernel size of 3 with the filters of 256 with powers of 2 in 4 pooling and convolution layers starting from 32 which gave an accuracy of 73%.
	
2.In this architecture we have taken we have taken image size of 100X100 with the kernel size of 3 with the filters of 32 with powers of 2 in 1 pooling and convolution layers starting from 32 which gave an accuracy of 57%.
	
3.	In this architecture we have taken we have taken image size of 100X100 with the kernel size of 3 with the filters of 256 with powers of 2 in 4 pooling and convolution layers starting from 32 which gave an accuracy of 68% with no dropout layer.
	
4.	In this architecture we have taken we have taken image size of 100X100 with the kernel size of 3 with the filters of 64 with powers of 2 in 2 pooling and convolution layers starting from 32 which gave an accuracy of 65%.
	
5.	In this architecture we have taken we have taken image size of 100X100 with the kernel size of 3 with the filters of 64 with powers of 2 in 0 pooling and 2 convolution layers starting from 32 which gave an accuracy of 60%.
	
6.	In this architecture we have taken we have taken image size of 140X140 with the kernel size of 3 with the filters of 64 with powers of 2 in 2 pooling and convolution layers starting from 32 which gave an accuracy of 54%.
	
7.	In this architecture we have taken we have taken image size of 140X140 with the kernel size of 3 with the filters of 64 with powers of 2 in 2 pooling and convolution layers starting from 32 which gave an accuracy of 58% with no dropout layer.
	
8.	In this architecture we have taken we have taken image size of 140X140 with the kernel size of 3 with the filters of 128 with powers of 2 in 3 pooling and convolution layers starting from 32 which gave an accuracy of 71%.
	
9.	In this architecture we have taken we have taken image size of 40X40 with the kernel size of 3 with the filters of 256 with powers of 2 in 4 pooling and convolution layers starting from 32 which gave an accuracy of 26%.

10.	In this architecture we have taken we have taken image size of 140X140 with the kernel size of 3 with the filters of 256 with powers of 2 in 4 pooling and convolution layers starting from 32 which gave an accuracy of 68%.

From the above table we can say that we had good accuracy  in model1 with 256 filters and 4 layers of convolutional and pooling layers giving us an accuracy of 73%.

**Images:**

From the below results we can say that the rose images and tulip got a close match and some of the dandelions could not been recognized as we donâ€™t have such type of images in the training and predicted them as roses
